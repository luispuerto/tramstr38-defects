## Bathroom

One of tiles by the bathtub is really broken and it needs to be fixed. We would like to know if you are going to fix it or we need to fix it for ourselves. For us is specially dangerous since it crack has sharp edges and spikes and we have a little 10 months old that we bath there everyday and it's not the first time he try to touch it. It's definitely a hazard.
